# LLM-Hate-Filter

**Note**: The name is definitely a work in progress and subject to change. (Maybe something like Safespace Hub? I dunno.)

A tool for sorting out hate communications from comments, tweets, and more. Uses a self-hosted open source LLM artifical intelligence to analyze any messages from common platforms, pick a category to place it in, and let you read or ignore at will, or take action against as you want to.

Developer's personal message:

> Hi,
>
> I'm a fan of a great many content creators on YouTube and Twitch. In the wake of the indefinite hiatus of JoCat, one of the greatest content creators I've ever followed, I want to help creators who are suffering from abuse like him.
>
> I follow a lot of JoCat's friends and people who have been deeply influenced by him. I can see his absence hurts them deeply, even if they remain silent on the topic. I don't want to see them, or any content creator, have to leave for their mental well-being either.
>
> I don't know if this project will get off the ground. I don't know if anyone else will care. I just had an idea pass through my head and thought someone had to give it a try.

## Core Development Goals

1. **Private** - Messages for you shouldn't be shared with anyone else without your and their consent.
2. **Free and Open Source Forever** - Everyone deserves equal and easy access to ease of mind.
3. **Low Resource Requirements** - If the cost of running this software is prohibitive to using it, then we've failed to meet goal #2.
4. **Easy to Use** - If someone is unable to make the software work for them, then we've failed to meet goal #2.
5. **Reliable** - If this software can't be relied on to perform the same way continuously, we've failed to meet goal #2.
6. **Non-Destructive** - If an AI hallucinates and misplaces a good-willed message in the wrong category, that message should not be deleted. If a threat is made against you, you should be able to use that threat as evidence if  need be. In essence, this means that this should only be a tool to sort messages, not a tool to make them go away, unless the user specifically requests it after being specifically warned about the dangers involved.
7. **Testing Centered Development** - Test driven development is not universally agreed on to be practical, but implementing testing is essential for ease of development and essential in the pursuit of goal #5. Every feature should be tested, but implementation should be allowed to follow test design or vice-versa.

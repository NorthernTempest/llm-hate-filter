# What is LLM Hate Filter?

It's a way to filter out hate messages, comments, replies, and more. It's a way to maintain a healthy relationship with your community, and a healthy relationship with your occupation.

Content creators are often the target of hateful communications, and it can be difficult to deal with. This tool is designed to reduce the amount of interaction you have with hate. Hate in this context includes all kinds of detractive, abusive, and otherwise negative messages.
